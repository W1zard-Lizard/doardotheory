		<p>Dorado is suddenly like the day and night. It is a fish which as we all know,</p>
		<p> are under the sea.</p>
		<p> Dorado is more than 
			<p>whats below us but above us as well. </P>

		<hr>
		<p> The night becomes the day and the day becomes the night. Dorado is underneath us and above us. Maybe it's God and we should just accept that-that the film is trying to prove a point of this higher being. 
		<p>Just a kids animation you say, i think you are stubborn!</p>.
