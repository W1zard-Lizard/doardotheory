	<h1>Still Not Hooked?</h1>
		<p>The word "El" in the title <i>"El Dorado"</i> is just one letter away from creating the word "Eel" which i assume is totally intentional. The dude simply forgot an extra "e",  
	<p> AND If you didn't already know, eel is a type of fish...What a coincidence right? </p>
	<p>I think I've made my point here. But when discussing with my homie Chris K he sent me a screenshot of when he searched up Dorado. The screenshot showed a list of stars around Dorado. Dorado is a constellation. So not only is it a fish, or just a name for a movie, but a freaking constellation.</p>
	<p> Therefore my point here, is that we should be more than curious if not suspicious of the information we are given. It would be very uncanny if we didn't question such things. Dorado is more than just a kids animation film. It is above us, below us and as well infront of us.
  <p> <a href="https://castandspear.com/dorado-fish/">This links you to where you can find the Dorado fish. The link also gives careful steps on how to capture them which i dont recommend.</a> So that's my proof of Dorado being a fish solved to you. Now heres a link that is from wiki, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Dorado">List of stars in Dorado</a> In essence it, Dorado, is both below and above us. This leads to my final conclusion. He is a God.</p>   
		<h1>Dorado is suddenly like the day and night. Dorado is more than whats below the sea and as well above the sea and us essentially. I wouldn't have been to able to consider this if hadn't I plugged into Peter Frampton's famous track, "Baby, I love Your Way" which is a cover from <i>Big Mountain</i>. This song opened my third sense which is to look <i>beneath the surface</i> of what the animation film is presening us. This means to question and let that curiousity explode into a task of maybe AMBITION. Heck while you're at it, why not open up some texts of Sigmud Freud.</h1> <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/freudian-theory-2795845">

		<p> The night becomes the day and the day becomes the night. Dorado is underneath us and above us. Maybe it's God and we should just accept that-that the film is trying to prove a point of this higher being. 
		<b>Just a kids animation you say, i think you are stubborn!</b>. I dont know what the message behind the film is about because i have not watched it during my recent year of being 20. Although <b> Chris K</b> did. So ask him. He's on Tinder, Bumblebee, and Craigslist. I love this guy. </p>
		<p> I wouldn't have been to able to consider this <i>Dorado theory</i> if hadn't Chris K texted me the latest movie he has wathed while sitting on his couch with his roommates. </p>
		<p>After our convo over via text messages, i plugged into Peter Frampton's famous track,  "Baby, I love Your Way". Peter's angelic voice took me away, which was to sink in-to the twin size mattress that is beneath-the-border-of-bedstuy-bushwick. I am renting in this area. Also weird fact, this twin size mattress was here before i even started to rent the place i will be living in--maybe till my homie Zach picks me up in his truck and takes me to his home in Wilmington North Carolina. Also if he does we hope to stop by at Virginia and see our other homie whose name is also Chris K .</p>
